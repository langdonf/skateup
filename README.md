SkateUp is a longboarding meet-up site that allows users to host e-skate group rides in their area. Users can create customized profiles, view local events and get information on upcoming meet-ups. 

## Motivation

There is a big group ride scene especially with the e-skate community.  I was always seeing posts on reddit or local forums about upcoming group rides, so I thought it would be fun to build an app designed for that purpose.
